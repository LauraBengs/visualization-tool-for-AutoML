# visualisation-tool-for-AutoML
This is the github repository for my bachelor thesis "How can a visualisation tool increase trust in AutoML systems and does it help users to better understand AutoML processes? - Development of a visualisation tool for an AutoML system"

AutoML is a promising area of research that is constantly gaining importance. Nevertheless, AutoML systems have some major drawbacks. The blackbox character of these systems makes it impossible for the users to understand what is going on during calculations, leading to a lack of user trust, low understandability, bad interpretability and a refusal to adapt AutoML solutions. The goal of this thesis is to illustrate the AutoML process to users by visualising a graph based search through different visual attributes of a directed acyclic graph. Therefore a corresponding visualisation tool is being developed. This tool should provide the user with more information about the process, presenting a possibility to understand what is happening during calculations and what decision are being made. Consequently the hope is to get the human back in the loop, including to open up the black box character of AutoML systems, leading to increased trust as well as a higher user acceptance.
